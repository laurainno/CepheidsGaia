# CepheidsGaia
Folder created for the Gaia Sprint 2018
It contains the Catalog of Classical Cepheids in the Milky Way as produced by Gaia.

By using NIR data from 2MASS and Cepheids Period-Luminosity relations in the H and K bands
calibrated by Inno et al. 2016, I determined their distances. 

Values of distance from us, galactocentric radius, extinction in the K band
(The Cardelli et al. 1989 extinction law is assumed), and position [x,y,z]
of each Cepheid based on the NIR PL relations are included in the table.

Light Curves from Gaia of all the sources in this table have also been uploaded in the LC subfolde

The plot I made for my pitch slide, which shows the position of the Cepheids projected
onto the Galactic Plane, color code by Period (which is a proxy of the age, with long-period Cepheids
being 10 Myrs, and short-period ~250 Myr) and with the vector of the (mu, delta) proper motion idicated
by the arrows.
